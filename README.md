# Portfolio Website
Static Portfolio Webpage

I first made a folder for storing files for html code and css styles. 
Then linked html file with css styles via <link rel="stylesheet" href=" ">. 
Gave title to webpage.
started with headin, which contaons img and my name.
added 4 buttons of my socials in heading section. linked each button to my socials.
then created body and firslty added about section.
but the text was too long and was not reader friendly at first. so i learnt how to make an readmore-readless button.
the java script i copied from a yt channel
next i added skill section 
then experience
then education
added links of every institution and bodies i joined. each is target="_blank"
then scores in the exams i gave in my past
at last made a form but when we submit it doesn't transfer data somewhere else, as i do not know php or js.
submit returns data to the same webpage( can be confirmed by seeing url after submission).

then gave css styles by creating classes as per requirements
started by deciding to make webpage in dark theme
added hover and active sections too.
for evry division like experience, skills,education added transitions
styled buttons differently for every section.
